# Create and deploy a Python Flask application

> We have applications available for [Node.js Express](https://github.com/IBM/node-express-app), [Go Gin](https://github.com/IBM/go-gin-app), [Python Flask](https://github.com/IBM/python-flask-app), [Python Django](https://github.com/IBM/python-django-app), [Java Spring](https://github.com/IBM/java-spring-app), [Java Liberty](https://github.com/IBM/java-liberty-app), [Swift Kitura](https://github.com/IBM/swift-kitura-app), [Android](https://github.com/IBM/android-app), and [iOS](https://github.com/IBM/ios-app).

In this sample application, you will create a Python cloud application using Flask. This application contains an opinionated set of files for web serving:

- `public/index.html`
- `public/404.html`
- `public/500.html`

This application also enables a starting place for a Python microservice using Flask. A microservice is an individual component of an application that follows the **microservice architecture** - an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities. The microservice exposes a RESTful API matching a [Swagger](http://swagger.io) definition.

## Steps

You can [deploy this application to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/starter-kits/python-flask-app) or [build it locally](#building-locally) by cloning this repo first. After your app is live, you can access the `/health` endpoint to build out your cloud native application.

### Deploying to IBM Cloud

</p>

Click **Deploy to IBM Cloud** to deploy this same application to IBM Cloud. This option creates a deployment pipeline, complete with a hosted GitLab project and a DevOps toolchain. You can deploy your app to Cloud Foundry, a Kubernetes cluster, or a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. OpenShift is available only through a standard cluster, which requires you to have a billable account.

[IBM Cloud DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/devops) services provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks inside IBM Cloud.

### Building locally

To get started building this application locally, you can either run the application natively or use the [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) for containerization and easy deployment to IBM Cloud.

#### Native application development

* Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 
Running Flask applications has been simplified with a `manage.py` file to avoid dealing with configuring environment variables to run your app. From your project root, you can download the project dependencies with (NOTE: If you don't have pipenv installed, execute: `pip install pipenv`):

```bash
pipenv install
```

To run your application locally:

```bash
python manage.py start
```

`manage.py` offers a variety of different run commands to match the proper situation:
* `start`: starts a server in a production setting using `gunicorn`.
* `run`: starts a native Flask development server. This includes backend reloading upon file saves and the Werkzeug stack-trace debugger for diagnosing runtime failures in-browser.
* `livereload`: starts a development server via the `livereload` package. This includes backend reloading as well as dynamic frontend browser reloading. The Werkzeug stack-trace debugger will be disabled, so this is only recommended when working on frontend development.
* `debug`: starts a native Flask development server, but with the native reloader/tracer disabled. This leaves the debug port exposed to be attached to an IDE (such as PyCharm's `Attach to Local Process`).

There are also a few utility commands:
* `build`: compiles `.py` files within the project directory into `.pyc` files
* `test`: runs all unit tests inside of the project's `test` directory

Your application is running at: `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.
- Your [Swagger UI](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) is running on: `/explorer`
- Your Swagger definition is running on: `/swagger/api`
- Health endpoint: `/health`

There are two different options for debugging a Flask project:
1. Run `python manage.py runserver` to start a native Flask development server. This comes with the Werkzeug stack-trace debugger, which will present runtime failure stack-traces in-browser with the ability to inspect objects at any point in the trace. For more information, see [Werkzeug documentation](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/).
2. Run `python manage.py debug` to run a Flask development server with debug exposed, but the native debugger/reloader turned off. This grants access for an IDE to attach itself to the process (i.e. in PyCharm, use `Run` -> `Attach to Local Process`).

You can also verify the state of your locally running application using the Selenium UI test script included in the `scripts` directory.

> **Note for Windows users:** `gunicorn` is not supported on Windows. You may start the server with `python manage.py run` on your local machine or build and start the Dockerfile.

#### IBM Cloud Developer Tools

Install [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) on your machine by running the following command:
```
curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
```

Create an application on IBM Cloud by running:

```bash
ibmcloud dev create
```

This will create and download a starter application with the necessary files needed for local development and deployment.

Your application will be compiled with Docker containers. To compile and run your app, run:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build
ibmcloud dev run
```

This will launch your application locally. When you are ready to deploy to IBM Cloud on Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes, run one of the commands:

```bash
ibmcloud dev deploy -t buildpack // to Cloud Foundry
ibmcloud dev deploy -t container // to K8s cluster
```

You can build and debug your app locally with:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build --debug
ibmcloud dev debug
```
